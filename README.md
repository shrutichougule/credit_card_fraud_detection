# credit_card_fraud_detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection using HTM-CLA, H-DS, and H-MSC Classifiers.

# Overview
This project demonstrates a robust system for detecting credit card fraud using advanced machine learning classifiers: HTM-CLA (Hierarchical Temporal Memory â€“ Cortical Learning Algorithm), H-DS (Hybrid Decision System), and H-MSC (Hybrid Multi-Stage Classifier). The solution is implemented on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability, efficiency, and real-time detection.

Explainable Results: Model results include interpretability metrics to understand fraud patterns.
# Tech Stack
Programming Languages:

Python
SQL
Libraries & Frameworks:

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
NuPIC (for HTM-CLA implementation)
Big Data & Cloud Services:

GCP: BigQuery, Dataflow, Cloud Storage
Apache Beam
Pub/Sub for real-time data streaming
#Architecture

1. Data Ingestion:

Transactions are streamed into GCP using Pub/Sub.
Historical data stored in Cloud Storage.
2. Data Processing:

Data is cleaned and transformed using Apache Beam (Dataflow).
Features are engineered to feed into the classifiers.
3. Model Deployment:

HTM-CLA, H-DS, and H-MSC classifiers are trained on historical data.
Deployed via GCP AI Platform for inference.
4. Fraud Detection:

Predictions are processed in real-time and stored in BigQuery for visualization and monitoring.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a publicly available credit card fraud dataset containing anonymized features.

Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
Key Features:

30 Features including Time, Amount, and anonymized principal components.
Highly imbalanced: Only ~0.17% of transactions are fraudulent.
