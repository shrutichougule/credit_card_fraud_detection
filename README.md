# credit_card_fraud_detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection using HTM-CLA, H-DS, and H-MSC Classifiers.

Overview
This project demonstrates a robust system for detecting credit card fraud using advanced machine learning classifiers: HTM-CLA (Hierarchical Temporal Memory â€“ Cortical Learning Algorithm), H-DS (Hybrid Decision System), and H-MSC (Hybrid Multi-Stage Classifier). The solution is implemented on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability, efficiency, and real-time detection.
